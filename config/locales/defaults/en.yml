      patchwork: "When we, Kadriye and Hilal, set up the Sivumbike Patchwork, with our own pronunciation of the name Süvümbike, we set off with the idea of a design that would remember, cherish and understand the past, but also a design that would take a step towards the new. “Patchwork”, known as “kırkyama” in our Turkish culture, is an artisanal handicraft and an art that provides the freedom to design and to create with the spirit of entrepreneurship. In English, “patchwork” signifies the work to patch together pieces. The origins of its Turkish sister “kırkyama”, literally “forty patches”, is the act of sewing together old pieces of fabric. With Sivumbike Patchwork, we aim to bring our designs to life and to introduce them to an audience who is or might be interested."

      sivumbike: "Sivumbike, also known by Suyumbike or Süyümbike, is a symbol of freedom for the Tatar people. Süyümbike was a Tatar queen born from nobility, originally a descendant of the Nogay family. Süyümbike, who was renown for her beauty, devotion and heroism, also symbolizes the decisive struggle of the Tatar Khanate against the Russian invasion. This “great-spirited woman” was said to have fought shoulder-to-shoulder against her enemies alongside her soldiers. However, in 1553 as the Khanate of Kazan fell against the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible, Süyümbike fell into the hand of Ivan the Terrible... Süyümbike died in captivity in Moscow in 1554, and, even today, is remembered with longing as the mother of the Tatar nation. She has gained an unforgettable place in the minds of her people, who have since told her legends and sang her song filled with heroism and sorrow. Nowadays, many women in Kazan continue to proudly call their daughters Süyümbike."

      we: "We are two friends who have over twenty years of patchwork experience and know-how. We learned how to do patchwork from our elders, developing it with our own curiosity; and now we continue to teach each other. Our friendship grew while discussing colors, materials, and fabric arrangement and now we bring it to you, around a business partnership. Through our website, you can visit the Gallery page to view our designs or contact us to discuss about patchwork and “kırkyama”."
